## auth notes

User Model has a method that we can generates the JWT token 

Should be able to look at the token and receive the userId from the token

I have the user id as the payload of the token

{
    "email": "testertest@test.com",
    "password": "testertest"
}

{
    "email": "testertest09@test.com",
    "password": "testertest09"
}
